# Beta 1.7.3 Music Discs
My first Babric/StAPI mod. Work in progress. Better than Music+... hopefully

Relese on modrith coming SOON! (yay)

Shoutout to @Slainlight on discord for telling me how to do the majority of this.

## To Do List/Future Plans
- add wait(where are we now)
- remove redunant world renderer mixin
- add Pigstep and Otherside
  - Need to bypass the hardcoded C418 credit
  - Pigstep would be obtained by killing ghast
